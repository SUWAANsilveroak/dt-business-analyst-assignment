# Task 1 – Daily Micro-Audit Routine

This document describes exactly what I do every day to keep clinic inventory clean and staff alert.  
Total time: **20–30 minutes/day**.

---

## STEP 1 — Identify High-Risk Medicines (One-time)

I create a list of medicines that need daily attention.

I mark a medicine as high-risk if:
- It sells in high volume
- It has confusing or similar names
- It is frequently prescribed

I finalize this list once and review it monthly.

---

## STEP 2 — Daily Name-Variation Check (10 mins)

**I have 2 approaches.** 

1st:- I will explain as per assignment suggested

2nd:- My approach as per my previous expirence 

### Approach 1 — As Suggested in the Assignment

I filter the sales register to show **only high-risk medicines**.

I group different entered names that refer to the same medicine.

I look for:
- New name variants
- Misspellings not seen earlier

If I find a new variant:
- I add it to the mapping list
- I inform billing staff to use the standard name

### 2nd My Approach (Recomendad)

I apply **data validation** at the sales or billing entry level.

What I do:
- I use the existing *Medicine (Master Name)* list as a data validation range
- Billing staff can select medicine names only from this standard list
- I share a simple SOP and a master list sorted alphabetically
- No heavy training or practice is required

Outcome:
- Staff can enter only valid medicine names
- Name-related human errors are eliminated
- Closing stock mismatches reduce significantly
- No daily follow-up with billing staff is required

---

## STEP 3 — Daily Usage Reasonableness Check (5–10 mins)

Even with data validation in place, daily stock checks are mandatory.

For each high-risk medicine, I calculate:

Expected Closing Stock  
= Opening Stock + Purchases − Total Sales (after grouping)

I compare expected stock with actual closing stock.

If the difference is more than the allowed tolerance:
- I review the day’s sales entries
- I check for missed or wrongly entered bills

---

## STEP 4 — Random Bill Spot Check (5–10 mins)

I randomly select **3–5 bills** that include high-risk medicines.

For each bill, I verify:
- Medicine name matches the master name
- Quantity looks reasonable for a typical prescription

Any error found is logged for correction only.

---

## STEP 5 — Error Logging

I record all errors in a simple log:
- Date
- Medicine
- Error type
- Whether it has occurred before

No punishment is involved.  
The objective is correction, awareness, and addressing staff challenges related to the updated SOP and system.
---

## STEP 6 — Doctor Escalation (Only When Needed)

I believe other departments should focus on their core responsibilities rather than handling miscellaneous tasks or corrections.

I'll involve the doctor only if:
- Financial impact is material
- The same error keeps repeating despite corrections
- Inventory mismatch affects treatment availability

All routine issues are handled without disturbing the doctor.
