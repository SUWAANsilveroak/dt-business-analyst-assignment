# Task 1 – Checklists

These checklists ensure the inventory micro-audit runs consistently with minimal effort and without disturbing the doctor.

## Daily Checklist (20–30 mins)

I run the following steps every day:

- Open opening inventory, sales register, and closing inventory
- Filter sales register for **high-risk medicines**
- Perform name-variation check (or confirm data validation is followed)
- Calculate expected vs actual stock for high-risk medicines
- Review differences beyond allowed tolerance
- Randomly check 3–5 bills involving high-risk medicines
- Log any errors or observations

## Weekly Checklist (15 mins)

Once a week, I do the following:

- Review the error log for repeated issues
- Identify common error types (name, quantity, missed entry)
- Decide if staff retraining is required
- Update SOP or validation rules if needed
- Check if any issue meets doctor escalation criteria

## Monthly Review (Optional, 10 mins)

- Review high-risk medicine list
- Add or remove medicines based on recent patterns
- Confirm SOP and master lists are still relevant
