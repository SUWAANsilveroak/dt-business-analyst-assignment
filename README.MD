# DT CultureTech – Business Analyst Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the DT CultureTech Role Test Drive Assignment.

The objective of this assignment is to design **practical, runnable systems** for a clinic environment where:
- Operations are manual
- Errors are small but frequent
- Doctor time is extremely limited
- Discipline and early detection matter more than perfect reconciliation

The focus is on **how a system runs daily**, not on tools, automation, or advanced technology.
