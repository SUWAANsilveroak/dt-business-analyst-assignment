# AI Usage Disclosure

> *“I believe AI is meant to make work easier, not to replace creativity and logical thinking 😊”*

I used AI (ChatGPT) in a **limited and supportive way** during this assignment.

### How AI was used
- To help with **Markdown (.md) file formatting**
- To structure headings and improve readability
- To validate clarity of written content

### How AI was NOT used
- AI was **not used to generate system logic**
- AI was **not used to design workflows**
- AI was **not used to make decisions or assumptions**
- AI was **not used to replace my reasoning or domain understanding**

All system designs, process flows, checklists, tables, and decision rules in this repository are based on **my own thinking, experience, and interpretation** of the problem statements provided in the assignment.

AI was used strictly as a **writing and formatting assistant**, not as a problem-solving substitute.

I take full ownership of the logic, structure, and decisions presented in this submission.
